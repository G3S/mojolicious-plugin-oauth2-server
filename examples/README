The various parties:
--------------------

In this diagram the Resource Server also plays the part of the Authorization
Server

         __3_[dis]allow access from client to resource server____
        /                                                         \
       /                                                           \
      /     __1_client to use resource?___        __2_auth code__   \
     /     /                               \     /               \   \
    /     /                                 \   /                 \   \
[ Resource Owner ] <-> [ User Agent ] <-> [ Client ] <-> [ Resource Server ]
                                              \  \                  /  /
                                               \  \_4_access token_/  /
                                                \                    /
                                                 \_5_refresh token__/

1. Client wants to be able to manipulate Resource Server on behalf of the
   Resource Owner (the user).

2. Client gets an Authorization Code from Resource Server (this can only work
   if the Resource Server knows of the Client in advance - the Client must
   identify itself to the Resource Server).

3. Resource Server checks with Resource Owner that Client can act on behalf
   of Resource Owner (with the scopes requires by the Client). Resource Owner
   confirms/denies. In most cases the Resource Owner must be logged in on the
   Resource Server.

4. (If Client confirms in step 3) Client asks Resource Server for an access
   token - Client POSTs to Resource Server as the Client must pass the client
   secret in this part of the process. If client ids, secret, allowed scopes
   pass checks the Resource Server returns an access token back to the Client.

5. Client can use the access token to act on behalf of the Resource Owner until
   the access token expires or the Resource Owner revokes the access token (or
   scopes). If the access token expires the refresh token can be used to obtain
   a new access token from the Resource Server by the Client.

What we have available in this examples/ directory:
---------------------------------------------------

examples/oauth2_client.pl           - A Client

examples/oauth2_server_simple.pl    - An Authorization Server and Resource Server
                                     (that only runs one proc and will not retain
                                     tokens across restarts) in its simplest form

examples/oauth2_server_realistic.pl - An Authorization Server and Resource Server
                                     (that can handle multiple procs and restarts
                                     without losing know tokens - although will
                                     not scale, you should use a database really)

web browser / /usr/bin/curl        - A User Agent

the command line                   - A Resource Owner (A person, You!)

To run:
-------

cd examples;
perl -I../lib ~/bin/morbo -l "https://*:3000" oauth2_server_realistic.pl &
perl ~/bin/morbo -l "https://*:3001" oauth2_client.pl &

Then:
-----

Visit https://127.0.0.1:3001 and click "Connect to Overly Attached Social
Network" then "login" and confirm permissions, you will be given a JSON response
that should contain the details of the access token (if you don't deny access)
that you can use to access the API of Overly Attached Social Network. The JSON
response will also contain the refresh token, type, and the expires_in details.

So on the command line (which we are substituting for calls that would be made
by TrendyNewService here):

# should say "Lee Annoyed Friends":
curl -k -H"Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  https://127.0.0.1:3000/api/annoy_friends

# should say "Lee Posted Image":
curl -k -H"Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  https://127.0.0.1:3000/api/post_image

# should say "You cannot track location" (with a 401 status):
curl -k -H"Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  https://127.0.0.1:3000/api/track_location

# should say "Unauthorized" (with a 401 status):
curl -k -H"Authorization: Bearer foo" \
  https://127.0.0.1:3000/api/annoy_friends

# You can even use the refresh token to generate a new access token:
curl -k -XPOST https://127.0.0.1:3000/oauth/access_token \
  -d "client_id=TrendyNewService&refresh_token=$refresh_token&grant_type=refresh_token" | json_pp
